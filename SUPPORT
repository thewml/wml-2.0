  Here you can reach the WML author Ralf S. Engelschall and the current
  maintainer Denis Barbier plus currently approximately 210 other people who
  use WML and which can help you in case of problems. Use this forum to spread
  your WML-related ideas and suggestion, too. Feel free to ask anything
  WML-related you want.

  Mailing List Subscription
  -------------------------

  To subscribe to this Majordomo-controlled mailing list, just send an E-mail
  to majordomo@engelschall.com (*NOT* to sw-wml@engelschall !!) with only
