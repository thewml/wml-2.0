  iSelect -- Interactive Selection Tool

  iSelect is an interactive line selection tool for ASCII files, operating
  via a full-screen Curses-based terminal session. It can be used either as
  an user interface frontend controlled by a Bourne-Shell/Perl/Tcl backend
  as its control script or in batch mode as a pipeline filter (usually
  between grep and the final executing command).   

  Version 1.2.0 (31-Mar-1999)
