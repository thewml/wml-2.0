2.3.5 August 13, 2001
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the Linklint program, which is an
Open Source Perl program that checks local and remote \s-1HTML\s0 links.
.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has
documentation in the \s-1HTML\s0 format; see below.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.SS "Input File Selection"
.IX Subsection "Input File Selection"
Whether you are doing a local site check or an \s-1HTTP\s0 site check, you
specify which directories (presumably containing \s-1HTML\s0 files) to check
with one or more linksets. A linkset uses two wildcard characters
@ and #.
Each linkset specifies one or more directories much like the standard
* and ? wildcard characters are used to specify the characters in the
* names of files in one directory.
.PP
The @ character matches any string of characters (this kind of acts like
\&\*(L"*\*(R"), and the # character (which is kind of like \*(L"?\*(R") matches any string
of characters except \*(L"/\*(R" . The best way to understand how @ and # work
is to look at a few examples:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&                          the entire site /@
\&              the homepage only (default) /
\&         files in the root directory only /#
\&             . . . and one directory down /#/#
\&          files in the sub directory only /sub/#
\&     files in the sub directory and below /sub/@
\&                           specific files /file1 /file2 ...
\&                  specific subdirectories /sub1/@ /sub2/@ ...
.Ve
.PP
If you specify more than one linkset, files matching any of the linksets
will be checked. \s-1HTML\s0 files that don't match any of the linksets will be
skipped. Linklint will see if they exist but won't check any of their
links.
.SS "Other File Selection Options"
.IX Subsection "Other File Selection Options"
.IP "\fB\-skip\fR \fIskipset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-skip skipset"
Skips \s-1HTML\s0 files that match \fIskipset\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR will make sure
these files exist but won't add any of their links to the list of files
to check.  Multiple \fIskipsets\fR are allowed, but each must be preceded
with \fB\-skip\fR on the command line. Skipsets use the same wildcard
characters as linksets.
.IP "\fB\-ignore\fR \fIignoreset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ignore ignoreset"
Ignores files matching \fIignoreset\fR.  \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR doesn't even check to
see if these files exist.  Multiple \fIignoresets\fR are allowed, but each
must be preceded with \fB\-ignore\fR on the command line.  Ignoresets use
the same wildcard characters as linksets.
.IP "\fB\-limit\fR \fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-limit n"
Limits checking to \fIn\fR \s-1HTML\s0 files (default 500).  All \s-1HTML\s0 files after
the first \fIn\fR are skipped.
.SS "Local Site Checking"
.IX Subsection "Local Site Checking"
If you are developing \s-1HTML\s0 pages on a computer that does not have an
http server, or if you are developing a simple site that does not use
Server Redirection or extensive \s-1CGI,\s0 you should use local site checking.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint /@
.Ve
.PP
Checks all \s-1HTML\s0 files in the current directory and below. Assumes that
the current directory is the server root directory so links starting
with \*(L"/\*(R" default to this directory. You must specify \fB/@\fR to check the
entire site. See Which Files to Check for details.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint \-root dir /@
.Ve
.PP
Checks all \s-1HTML\s0 files in dir and below. This is useful if you want to
check several sites on the same machine or if you don't want to run
Linklint in your public \s-1HTML\s0 directory.
.SS "Other Local Site Options"
.IX Subsection "Other Local Site Options"
.IP "\fB\-host\fR \fIhostname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-host hostname"
By default \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR assumes all links on your site that start with
\&\f(CW\*(C`http://\*(C'\fR are remote links to other sites.  If you have absolute links
to your own site, give \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR your hostname and links starting with
\&\f(CW\*(C`http://hostname\*(C'\fR will be treated as local files.  If you specify
\&\fB\-host hostname:port,\fR only http links to this hostname and port will
be treated as local files.
.IP "\fB\-case\fR" 4
.IX Item "-case"
Makes sure that the filename (upper/lower) case used links inside of
html tags matches the case used by the file system.  This is for
Windows only and is very handy if you are porting a site to a Unix
host.
.IP "\fB\-orphan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-orphan"
Checks all directories that contain files used on the site for unused
(orphan) files.
.IP "\fB\-index\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-index file"
Uses \fIfile\fR as the default index file instead of the default list used
by \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR. You can specify more than one file but each one must be
preceded by \fB\-index\fR on the command line.  If a default index file is
not found, \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR uses a listing of the entire directory. See the
Default File section for details.
.IP "\fB\-map\fR \fI/a=[/b]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-map /a=[/b]"
Substitutes leading \fI/a\fR with \fI/b\fR.  For server-side image maps or to
simulate Server Redirection.
.IP "\fB\-no_warn_index\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_warn_index"
Turns of the \*(L"index file not found\*(R" warning.  Applies to local site
checking only.
.IP "\fB\-no_anchors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_anchors"
Tells \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR to ignore named anchors.  This could ease memory
problems for people with large sites who are primarily interested in
missing pages and not missing named anchors.  This option works for
both \s-1HTTP\s0 and local site checks.
.SS "\s-1HTTP\s0 Site Checking"
.IX Subsection "HTTP Site Checking"
If you have a complicated site that uses lots of \s-1CGI\s0 or Server
Redirection, you should use \s-1HTTP\s0 site checking. Even though an \s-1HTTP\s0
site check reads pages via your \s-1HTTP\s0 server, you will get the best
performance if you do your checking on a machine that has a high speed
connection to your server.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint \-http \-host www.site.com /@
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-http\fR flag tells \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR to check \s-1HTML\s0 files on the site
www.site.com via a remote http connection. You must specify a \-host
whenever you do an \s-1HTTP\s0 site check (otherwise Linklint won't where to
get your pages). You can specify \fB/@\fR to check the entire site.  See Which
Files to Check for details.
.SS "\s-1HTTP\s0 Site Check Options"
.IX Subsection "HTTP Site Check Options"
.IP "\fB\-http\fR" 4
.IX Item "-http"
This flag tells Linklint to perform an \s-1HTTP\s0 site check instead of a
local site check.  All files (except server side image maps) will be
read via the \s-1HTTP\s0 protocol from your web server.
.IP "\fB\-host\fR \fIhostname:port\fR" 4
.IX Item "-host hostname:port"
If you include \fI:port\fR at the end of your
hostname, Linklint uses this port for the \s-1HTTP\s0 site check.
.IP "\fB\-password\fR \fIrealm user:password\fR" 4
.IX Item "-password realm user:password"
Uses \fIuser\fR and \fIpassword\fR as authorization to enter password
protected \fIrealm.\fR Realms are named areas of a site that share a common
set of usernames and passwords.  If passwords are needed to check your
site, Linklint will tell you which realms need passwords in warning
messages.  Enclose the realm in double quotes if it contains spaces.  If
no password is given for a specific realm, Linklint will try using the
password for the "\f(CW\*(C`DEFAULT\*(C'\fR" realm if it was provided.
.IP "\fB\-timeout\fR \fIt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-timeout t"
Times out after \fIt\fR seconds (default 15) when
getting files via http.  Once data is received, an additional
\&\fIt\fR seconds is allowed.  The timeout is
disabled on Windows machines since the Windows port of Perl does not
support the \f(CW\*(C`alarm()\*(C'\fR function.
.IP "\fB\-delay\fR \fId\fR" 4
.IX Item "-delay d"
Delays \fId\fR seconds between requests to the same
host (default 0).  This is a friendly thing to do especially if you are
checking many links on the same host.
.IP "\fB\-local\fR \fIlinkset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-local linkset"
Gets files that match \fIlinkset\fR locally.  The default \fB\-local\fR
\&\fIlinkset\fR is \fB@.map\fR (which matches any link ending in \fI.map\fR).  This
allows Linklint to follow links through server-side image maps.  The
default is ignored if you specify your own \fB\-local\fR expressions.  You
need to specify the \fB\-root\fR directory for this option to work propery.
.IP "\fB\-map\fR \fI/a=[/b]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-map /a=[/b]"
Substitutes leading \fI/a\fR with \fI/b\fR.  For server-side image maps or to
simulate Server Redirection.
.IP "\fB\-no_anchors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_anchors"
Tells \f(CW\*(C`Linklint\*(C'\fR to ignore named anchors.
.IP "\fB\-no_query_string\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_query_string"
Up until version 2.3.4, Linklint did not use query strings while doing
\&\s-1HTTP\s0 site checks.  Query strings were removed before making \s-1HTTP\s0
requests.  As of 2.3.4 query strings in links are used in the
requests.  Use the \fB\-no_query_string\fR flag to get back the \*(L"old\*(R"
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-http_header\fR \fIName:value\fR" 4
.IX Item "-http_header Name:value"
Adds the \s-1HTTP\s0 header \fIName: value\fR to all \s-1HTTP\s0 requests
generated by Linklint.  You will need to use quotation marks to hide
spaces in the header line from the command line interpreter. Linklint
will automatically add a space after the first colon if there is not
one there already.  Multiple (unique) header lines are allowed.
.IP "\fB\-language\fR \fIzz\fR" 4
.IX Item "-language zz"
This option is only useful if you are checking a site that uses
content negotiation to present the same \s-1URL\s0 in different languages.
.Sp
Creates an \s-1HTTP\s0 Request header of the form
\&\fBAccept-Language: zz\fR that is included as part of all \s-1HTTP\s0
requests generated by Linklint.  Multiple \fB\-language\fR
specifications are allowed.  This will result in a single
\&\fBAccept-Language:\fR header that lists all of the languages you
have specified in alphabetical order.  Some web sites can use this
information to return pages to you in a specific language.
.Sp
If you need to get more complicated than this, use the more general
purpose \fB\-http_header\fR to create your own header.  There is a partial
list of language abbreviations (taken from Debian) included as part of
the Linklint documentation.
.SS "Remote \s-1URL\s0 Checking"
.IX Subsection "Remote URL Checking"
A remote \s-1URL\s0 check is used to see if a remote \s-1URL\s0 exists (or has been
recently modified). Links in the remote pages are not checked nor does
Linklint look for named anchors in remote URLs.
.PP
Remote \s-1URL\s0 checking can be used to check all of the \*(L"remote\*(R" links on
your site (those that link to pages on other sites) or it can check a
list of URLs. There are several ways to specify which remote URLs to
check:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint http://somehost/file.html
.Ve
.PP
Checks to see if \fI/file.html\fR exists on somehost. Multiple URLs can be
entered on the command line, in an \fI\f(CI@commandfile\fI\fR, or in an
\&\fI@@httpfile\fR.  Every \s-1URL\s0 to be checked must begin with \f(CW\*(C`http://\*(C'\fR. This
will disable site checking.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint @@httpfile
.Ve
.PP
Checks all the remote http URLs found in httpfile. Anything in the file
starting with \f(CW\*(C`http://\*(C'\fR is considered to be a \s-1URL.\s0 If the file looks
like a \fIremoteX.txt\fR file generated by Linklint then all failed URLs will
be cross referenced.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint @@ \-doc linkdoc
.Ve
.PP
Assuming you have already done a site check and used \fB\-doc linkdoc\fR to
put all of your output files in the linkdoc directory, Linklint will
check all the remote links that were found on your site and cross
reference all failed URLs without doing a site check. You can use the
\&\fB\-netmod\fR or \fB\-netset\fR flags to enable the status-cache.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     linklint \-net [site check options]
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-net\fR flag tells Linklint to check all remote links after doing
either a local or \s-1HTTP\s0 site check site. If you are having memory
problems, don't use the \fB\-net\fR option, instead use one of the \fB@@\fR
options above.
.SS "Other Remote \s-1URL\s0 Options"
.IX Subsection "Other Remote URL Options"
.IP "\fB\-timeout\fR \fIt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-timeout t"
Times out after \fIt\fR seconds (default 15) when getting files via http.
Once data is received, an additional \fIt\fR seconds is allowed.  The
timeout is disabled on Windows machines since the Windows port of Perl
does not support the \f(CW\*(C`alarm()\*(C'\fR function.
.IP "\fB\-delay\fR \fId\fR" 4
.IX Item "-delay d"
Delays \fId\fR seconds between requests to the same host (default 0).  This
is a friendly thing to do especially if you are checking many links on
the same host.
.IP "\fB\-redirect\fR" 4
.IX Item "-redirect"
Checks for <meta> redirects in the headers of remote  URLs that
are html files.  If a redirect is found it is followed.  This feature is
disabled if the status cache is used.
.IP "\fB\-proxy\fR \fIhostname[:port]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-proxy hostname[:port]"
Sends all remote \s-1HTTP\s0 requests through the proxy server \fIhostname\fR and
the optional \fIport\fR.  This allows you to check remote URLs or (new with
version 2.3.1) your entire site from within a firewall that has an http
proxy server.  Some error messages (relating to host errors) may not be
available through a proxy server.
.IP "\fB\-concise_url\fR" 4
.IX Item "-concise_url"
Turns off printing successful URLs to \s-1STDOUT\s0 during remote link
checking.
.SS "Status Cache Options"
.IX Subsection "Status Cache Options"
The Status Cache is a very powerful feature. It allows you to keep track
of recent changes in all of the remote (off-site) pages you link to. You
can then use the Linklint output files to quickly check changed pages to
see if they still meet your needs.
.PP
The flags below make use of the status cache file linklint.url (kept in
your \s-1HOME\s0 or \s-1LINKLINT\s0 directory). This file keeps track of the
modification dates of all the remote URLs that you check.
.IP "\fB\-netmod\fR" 4
.IX Item "-netmod"
Operates just like \fB\-net\fR but makes use of the status cache.  Newly
checked URLs will be entered in the cache.  Linklint will tell you which
(previously cached) URLs have been modified since the last \fB\-netset\fR.
.IP "\fB\-netset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-netset"
Like \fB\-netmod\fR but also resets the last modified status in the cache
for all URLs that checked ok.  If you always use \fB\-netset\fR, modified
URLs will be reported just once.
.IP "\fB\-retry\fR" 4
.IX Item "-retry"
Only checks URLs that have a host fail status in the cache.  Sometimes a
\&\s-1URL\s0 fails because its host is temporarily down.  This flag enables you
to recheck just those links.  An easy way to recheck all the cached URLs
with host failures is \f(CW\*(C`linklint @@ \-retry\*(C'\fR.  Use
\&\f(CW\*(C`linklint @@linkdoc/remoteX.txt \-retry\*(C'\fR if you want failed URLs to be
cross referenced.
.IP "\fB\-flush\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flush"
Removes all URLs from the cache that are not currently being checked.
The \fB\-retry\fR flag has no effect on which URLs are flushed.
.IP "\fB\-checksum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-checksum"
Ensures that every \s-1URL\s0 that has been modified is reported as such.  This
flag can make the remote checking take longer.  Many of the pages that
require a checksum are dynamically generated and will always be reported
as modified.
.IP "\fB\-cache\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-cache directory"
Reads and writes the \fIlinklint.url\fR cache file in this directory.  The
default directory is set by your \s-1LINKLINT\s0 or \s-1HOME\s0 environment variables.
.SS "Output Options"
.IX Subsection "Output Options"
No output files are generated by default, only progress and a brief
summary of the results are printed to the screen. You can produce
complete documentation (split up into separate files) in a \fB\-doc\fR
directory or put selected output in a single \fB\-out\fR file or by
redirecting the standard output to a file. See the Output File
Specification section for a detailed description of all output files.
.SS "Multi File Output"
.IX Subsection "Multi File Output"
.IP "\fB\-doc\fR \fIlinkdoc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-doc linkdoc"
Sends all output to the \fIlinkdoc\fR directory.  The output is divided
into separate \fI.txt\fR and \fI.html\fR files.  Complete documentation is
always produced regardless of the single file flags.
.Sp
The file \fIindex.txt\fR contains an index to all the other files;
\&\fIindex.html\fR is an \s-1HTML\s0 version of the index.  The index files for
remote \s-1URL\s0 checking are \fIur_lindex.txt\fR and \fIurl_index.html\fR.
.IP "\fB\-textonly\fR" 4
.IX Item "-textonly"
Prevents any \s-1HTML\s0 files from being created in the \fB\-doc\fR directory.
.IP "\fB\-htmlonly\fR" 4
.IX Item "-htmlonly"
Erases redundant text files in the \fB\-doc\fR directory after they have
been used to create the \s-1HTML\s0 output files.  The files \fIremote.txt\fR and
\&\fIremoteX.txt\fR are not erased since they can be used by Linklint to
recheck remote URLs.
.IP "\fB\-docbase\fR \fIbase\fR" 4
.IX Item "-docbase base"
Overrides the default \fIbase\fR expression used for directing a browser to
the resources listed in the output \s-1HTML\s0 files.  The base is prepended to
local links in the output \s-1HTML\s0 files.  This only affects the links in
\&\s-1HTML\s0 output files, it has no effect on what is displayed in these files.
Ordinarily this flag would only be used during a local site check to set
the base to \f(CW\*(C`http://host\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-output_frames\fR" 4
.IX Item "-output_frames"
All \s-1HTML\s0 output data files are linked to from \fIindex.html\fR.  If you use
this flag then the the data files will be opened up in a new frame
(window) which can be handy in some cases since it always leaves the
\&\fIindex.html\fR file open in its own window.
.IP "\fB\-output_index\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-output_index filename"
The output index files were previously named \fIlinklint.txt\fR and
\&\fIlinklint.html\fR.  These have now been changed to \fIindex.txt\fR and
\&\fIindex.html\fR.  You can use the \fB\-output_index\fR option to change this
name back to \f(CW\*(C`linklint\*(C'\fR or to something else.
.IP "\fB\-url_doc_prefix\fR \fIurl/\fR" 4
.IX Item "-url_doc_prefix url/"
By default, the output files associate with remote \s-1URL\s0 checking all
start with \*(L"url\*(R".  You can change this with the \fB\-url_doc_prefix\fR
option.  If the url_doc_prefix contains a \*(L"/\*(R" character then the
appropriate directory will be created (as a subdirectory of the \-doc
directory).
.IP "\fB\-dont_output\fR \fIxxxx\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dont_output xxxx"
Don't create output files that contain \*(L"xxxx\*(R".  Can be repeated.
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-dont_output "X$"
.Ve
.Sp
will supress the output of all cross reference files.
.SS "Single File Output"
.IX Subsection "Single File Output"
.IP "\fB\-error\fR" 4
.IX Item "-error"
Lists missing files and other errors.
.IP "\fB\-out\fR \fIfile\fR" 4

Sends list output and summary information to \fIfile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-list"
Lists all found files, links, directories etc.
.IP "\fB\-warn\fR" 4
