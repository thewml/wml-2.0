  ChangeLog

  This file summarizes *all* types of changes to the Slice sources,
  i.e. changes between each patchlevel (1.x.y->1.x.(y+1) and
  1.x.y->1.(x+1).0). Take this logfile for concrete and detailed
  information about every single change.
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.3.8 and ???:

    *) Checks on file errors (20-Apr-2002):
       File operations are checked and SLICE aborts if an error is detected.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix -y flag (19-Apr-2002):
       Slice did not abort with 's' or 'z' policy set to 3.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.3.7 and 1.3.8:

    *) New -y flag (12-Jan-2002):
       This flag changes output policy, by defining which action is to be
       taken when unknown slice sets are requested, or when input is empty.
       Note that an undefined set used was previously considered as an error,
       and it is now silently ignored by default.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change detection of Perl modules (12-Jan-2002):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Cosmetic changes (22-Jul-2001):
       Remove ampersands before function calls.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade to Autoconf 2.50 (22-Jul-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix compilation of Bit::Vector with perl < 5.005 (20-Jun-2001):
       Apply the 2001-08-27 patch by Max H. Duenki.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgraded to Bit::Vector 6.0 (04-May-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.3.6 and 1.3.7:

    *) Fix an infinite loop in slice 1.3.6  (27-Aug-2000):
       Previous patch about speed improvements made slice hang up with
       some files.  This patch has been entirely revisited.
       [Josip Rodin <joy@cibalia.gkvk.hr>]

    *) New `all except' operator (27-Aug-2000):
       The wildcard sign accepts a new syntax.  When followed by braces,
       it replaces ``all strings except the one enclosed within braces''.
       This construct could not be emulated with previous operators with
       nested slices.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix `%' operator (27-Aug-2000):
       This operator, which is a synonym for `n' i.e. intersection of
       slices, was only partially implemented
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix compilation of Bit::Vector with perl < 5.005 (27-Aug-2000):
       [Max H. Duenki <duenki@isi.ee.ethz.ch>]

  Changes between 1.3.5 and 1.3.6:

    *) Improve processing speed on large files (29-Jul-2000):
       On very large files, this program was dramatically slow.
       A speed-up factor of 15 is obtained on a 300KB file containing
       16000 slices.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix compilation on threaded Perl 5.6.0 (29-Jul-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of Bit::Vector (28-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded Bit::Vector from version 5.7 to 5.8.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.0 (01-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.0. This involved especially a major
       adjustment because of the rewritten "shtool version" command.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  Changes between 1.3.4 and 1.3.5:

    *) Fix compilation on FreeBSD  (27-Apr-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix detection of Perl at configure time  (27-Apr-2000):
       Perl 5.6.0 uses a versioning scheme different than previous
       versions, which breaks our detection scheme.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.3.3 and 1.3.4:

    *) Use of the TMPDIR environment variable (28-Aug-1999):
       To conform with POSIX standard, this variable contains 
       the directory name where temporary files are kept. By default, 
       this directory is /tmp.
       [Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>]

    *) Use GNU shtool for configuring (25-Aug-1999):
       All scripts in etc/ sub-directories were still replaced by
       Ralf's shtool since 01-Jul-1999. They are now removed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Write empty file (23-Aug-1999):
       An empty output implies an empty file. Previous versions
       did not write empty files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix installation of Perl modules (05-Jul-1999):
       On some platforms, Perl modules are not installed according
       to the prefix passed to the configure command-line.
       Rules in Makefiles now invoke pure_perl_install
       [Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>]

  Changes between 1.3.2 and 1.3.3:

    *) Upgrade Perl modules (21-May-1999):
       - Bit-Vector 5.6
       - IO 1.20
       - Getopt-Long 2.19
       [Denis Barbier <barbier@imacs.polytechnique.fr>]

    *) Fixed slice_term.y (10-May-1999):
       An undefined slice reports a warning instead of an error
       [Michael McNamara <mac@surefirev.com>]
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Slice is now maintained by Denis Barbier <barbier@imacs.polytechnique.fr>
  I've now changed the syntax of the ChangeLog file for more readability

      980218 - Upgraded to Bit-Vector 5.0b4

  Changes between 1.2.9 and 1.3.0

               option. This is very useful to avoid endless
               union-constructs in slice terms. To avoid
               conflicts the intersection now uses the
               characters [n%] instead of [n*].

               <foka@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> for patch]
             - changed Perl module version check according to the

             - fixed nasty bug when some slices are used more
               then once (for different output files but one with
               a negation).  [Thanks to Sebastian Wilhelmi for
               hint <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>]
             - fixed Debug output
             - fixed Perl interpreter determination because of
               Perl 5.004_04 where -v output changed.

             - added RESTRICTION section to slice.pod to make it
