**  ePerl -- Embedded Perl 5 Language
**
**  ePerl interprets an ASCII file bristled with Perl 5 program statements
**  by evaluating the Perl 5 code while passing through the plain ASCII
**  data. It can operate both as a standard Unix filter for general file
**  generation tasks and as a powerful Webserver scripting language for
**  dynamic HTML page programming.
