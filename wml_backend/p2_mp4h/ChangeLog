  This file summarizes *all* types of changes to the mp4h sources,
  i.e. changes between each patchlevel (0.x.y->0.x.(y+1) and
  0.x.y->0.(x+1).0). Take this logfile for concrete and detailed
  information about every single change.
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.3.0 and ???:

    *) Fix <directory-contents> (18-Oct-2002):
       Remove trailing newline.
       [Ralf Vissers <ravis@web.de>]

    *) Fix memory error in <array-shift> (27-Sep-2002):
       Some argument checks were missing in <array-shift> and could
       cause memory fault.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage <jms.debian@club-internet.fr>]

  Changes between 1.2.4 and 1.3.0:

    *) Replace configure flag about modules (06-Jul-2002):
       The --enable-modules flag is replaced by --with-modules, ans it
       now takes an optional argument which is the list of modules to
       install.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New <printf> tag (04-Jul-2002):
       It currently supports %s flag character, with $ extension.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve debugging for module loading (01-Jul-2002):
       The new -dm debugging flag gives information when loading modules.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Revamp module management (19-Jun-2002):
       Modules and packages are extensions for mp4h.  The former refered
       to shared libraries whereas the latter contain macros.
       Modules are loaded with <load> tag, and packages via the <use> tag.
       But this is confusing, because user had to know module internals
       to determine how to call it.
       These notions are now merged: every module must also have an
       associated package file, whose only task is to load shared library.
       Thus end-user only calls <use> macro, and <load> is hidden.
       the MP4HLIB environment variable may be used to set run-time
       search paths.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Use Automake (16-Jun-2002):
       Eventually Automake is back.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add support for i18n (16-Jun-2002):
       Add gettext support.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade to PCRE 3.9 (15-Jun-2002):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add intl:gettext module (13-Jun-2002):
       This module is an interface for gettext functions.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix module detection (18-Mar-2002):
       There were several bugs which caused failure when multiple paths
       were defined in MP4HMODPATH.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.6.0 (06-Mar-2002):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix literals (06-Mar-2002):
       mp4h 1.2.4 does not handle <@[ ]@> quotes as expected, they
       were simply discarded.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.2.3 and 1.2.4:

    *) Run autoconf in libltdl/ subdirectory (02-Mar-2002):
       The toplevel configure script could fail due to autoconf
       version mismatch.
       [Guido Draheim <guidod-2002-@gmx.de>]

    *) Fix <attributes-extract> and <attributes-remove> tags (11-Jan-2002):
       Valueless attributes in these tags crashed mp4h.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Do not abort with missing input files (05-Jan-2002):
       Just print a warning and skip this file.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Fix line numbers in error messages (10-Dec-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade to PCRE 3.7 (08-Nov-2001):
       Upstream do allow various definitions of newline char, I keep
       stuck with `\n' in internal.h until I know exactly how to
       incorporate this option.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.2.2 and 1.2.3:

    *) Fix leading space added by <attributes-quote> (25-Oct-2001):
       This space must not be added when attribute is empty.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.2.1 and 1.2.2:

    *) Leading space added by <attributes-quote> (18-Oct-2001):
       This tag is useful for printing HTML output.  This change allows
       writing <a<attributes-quote %attributes>> which prints <a> without
       attributes and <a foo="bar"> instead.  It is now much more user
       friendly because there is no need to first check whether there
       are attributes in order to decide to add a leading space or not.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change in handling invalid negative array indices (17-Oct-2001):
       They have now no effect, they did formerly reset variable.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Checks added for preserve/restore pairs (17-Oct-2001):
       A warning is raised at end of processing when some material
       remains on this stack.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix memory leaks (15-Oct-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix arrays (15-Oct-2001):
       Insertion of values inside arrays did fail under some
       circumstance.
       [Ghislaine Labouret <Ghislaine.Labouret@hsc.fr>]

  Changes between 1.2.0 and 1.2.1:

    *) Add support for case sensitiveness (30-Sep-2001):
       In HTML, tags are case insensitive unlike entities.  Moreover in
       XHTML, tags have also become case sensitive.  For these reasons,
       it is important to be able to decide at run time whether symbols
       are case sensitive or not.  A new -c flag does the job.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve documentation (29-Sep-2001):
       Entities are now used in place of some tags, and some typos
       are fixed.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Implement entity support (28-Sep-2001):
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Minor change in top level Makefile.in (26-Aug-2001):
       The `clean' and `distclean' targets are unconditionnally processed
       through the modules/ directory.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix version number in documentation (26-Aug-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.1.2 and 1.2.0:

    *) Allow compilation from another directory (14-Aug-2001):
       Makefiles are updated to allow compilation from another
       directory, when `make' supports the VPATH feature.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Clean up configure.ac (14-Aug-2001):
       The new AC_INIT form in Autoconf 2.50 does now its job, and
       version number is retrieved from src/version.c.  This was not as
       easy as with Autoconf 2.13, I hope this is the canonical way to
       insert some code to run before AC_INIT.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Install libraries in subdirectories (13-Aug-2001):
       As with <use>, double colons are replaced by slashes in <load>
       attributes, which allows putting libraries in subdirectories.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade to Autoconf 2.50 (12-Aug-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change <use> invocation (12-Aug-2001):
       Module name must now be set through `name' attribute.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Internal naming changes in src/builtin.c (11-Aug-2001):
       Future versions will be more modularized, and some care must be
       taken with naming conventions; more functions and variables will
       be prefixed by `mp4h_', so all functions called by predefined
       macros are renamed from mp4h_<foo> to mp4h_bp_<foo> to clearly
       identify builtin primitives.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Experimental UTF-8 support (21-Jul-2001):
       Compile PCRE 3.4 with UTF-8 support, 
       A new --encoding option accepts 2 values, either `8bit' or
       `utf8'.  When `utf8' is selected, regular expressions are
       compiled with PCRE_UTF8 flag.
       The <string-length> and <substring> tags are also
       encoding-dependent.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade to PCRE 3.4 (21-Jul-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix <get-file-properties> (21-Apr-2001):
       A segmentation fault occurred when uid or gid could not be
       resolved.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change module invocation (07-Apr-2001):
       The <loadmodule> tag is replaced by a more generic <load> tag,
       which works with shared library and mp4h modules.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Rearrange modules/ subdirectory (07-Apr-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New <set-var-x> tag (24-Mar-2001):
       Like <set-var>, but this is a complex tag.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) New <real-path> tag (24-Mar-2001):
       Returns absolute pathname of a file.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Clean-up src/builtin.c (24-Mar-2001):
       The mp4h_set_var_verbatim function is useless and removed.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Fix compilation on Tru64 (24-Mar-2001):
       [Stéphane Bortzmeyer]

    *) Improve <include> tag (14-Mar-2001):
       File name is passed through the `file' attribute, and a new
       `command' attribute allows reading output from arbitrary shell
       command.  As this might be considered as a security flaw, a new
       -S flag allows filtering potentially risky functions.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Add diversions (09-Mar-2001):
       Push diversion mechanisms back into mp4h.
       [Anders Dinsen]

    *) Improve <date> tag (09-Mar-2001):
       New `time' and `format' attributes make this tag much more
       powerful.
       [Anders Dinsen <anders@dinsen.net>]

    *) Remove special characters in debugging output (20-Feb-2001):
       [Axel Beckert <rse-wml@deuxchevaux.org>]

    *) New <disjoin> tag (20-Feb-2001):
       This tag does the opposite job of <group>, it explodes its
       attribute into several pieces.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bug with body tag surrounded by quotes (20-Feb-2001):
       When a body function was surrounded within double quotes (without
       any whitespace around), it was simply discarded.
       [Petr Andreyev <petr@xanadu.ru>]

  Changes between 1.1.1 and 1.1.2:

    *) Fix bugs with conditionals (07-Nov-2000):
       The <if>, <ifeq> and <ifneq> conditionals do not behave properly.
       Under rare circumstances, both THEN and ELSE clauses may be run.
       [Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>]

  Changes between 1.1.0 and 1.1.1:

    *) Fix trailing slash in empty complex tags (31-Aug-2000):
       They caused memory errors.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bugs with non-ASCII letters (31-Aug-2000):
       Mp4h gobbled some non-ASCII letters because of misuse of
       signedness.  Several similar bugs have been fixed.
       [Denis Barbier, Debian webmasters]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.1 (08-Aug-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.1. This especially fixed problems 
       with "shtool version" under Solaris.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  Changes between 1.0.6 and 1.1.0:

    *) Rename option to disable support for loadable modules (24-Jul-2000):
       This option is now `./configure --disable-modules'
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New -X option (21-Jul-2000):
       With -X=32, a trailing slash is appended to simple tag
       attributes.  For readibility and to follow appendix C of
       the XHTML 1.0 specifications, a space is inserted before
       this trailing slash.  When value 256 is also set, this space
       is not inserted.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add support for modifiers in regexps (21-Jul-2000):
       Only i, m, s and x modifiers have been added, U and X are
       specific to PCRE and have not been implemented.
       The `singleline' attribute has been changed.  It now accepts
       two values, `true' (like the s modifier) and `false' (like the
       m modifier).  Until now, `m' was the default, and singleline=true
       switches to `s'.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Clean Up in PCRE files (21-Jul-2000):
       Only used files are kept back.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Use of the native API of PCRE (21-Jul-2000):
       And support for locales has been added.  Mp4h is now fully
       powered by PCRE.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.0.5 and 1.0.6:

    *) Use of the PCRE library (20-Jul-2000):
       This library is copyrighted by University of Cambridge.
       With this library, Perl regular expressions may now be
       used instead of POSIX regular expressions.
       Current implementation in mp4h is quite weak, because we use
       the POSIX compatibility mode instead of native API.  Moreover
       one test of the test suite fails.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix some bugs with quotes (19-Jul-2000):
       Quotes have two functions: group multiple words into a single
       token in attributes, and its normal meaning (i.e. output quotes).
       The former must be removed, whereas the latter are preserved.
       This is quite tricky, and previous implementations failed under
       certain circumstances.  Now when quotes are seen outside of tag
       attributes, they are marked as being special and cannot be
       removed.
       The <dq> tag is also fixed.
       [Fritz Zaucker]

    *) Add support for loadable modules (12-Jul-2000):
       This stage was easy because GNU m4 1.4n already has such
       support.  Work has to be done to provide a nice API to
       module developers.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow trailing slash in empty complex tags (12-Jul-2000):
       It is now possible to write <foo/> even if `foo' has been
       declared as being complex.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix driver for Info documentation (11-Jul-2000):
       This driver is just an example to determine if it is worth trying
       to write Info files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Forbid negative indices in arrays (11-Jul-2000):
       A negative index returns an empty value.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve <attributes-extract> and <attributes-remove> (10-Jul-2000):
       These functions now accept matches against regular expressions,
       and new examples in documentation explain how to define a macro
       which may pass its attributes to HTML tags.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix `beginning of line' bug in regular expressions (09-Jul-2000):
       The `^' special character was not interpreted.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.0.4 and 1.0.5:

    *) Minor fix to restore compatibility with old syntax (09-Jul-2000):
       It is possible (but not desirable) to put square brackets after
       a variable name to show that this variable is an array of
       newline separated lists.
       This fix restores this capability which is broken in 1.0.4
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4:

    *) Internal change in hash tables (08-Jul-2000):
       Until now, variables and macros shared the same hash table.
       They now have their own tables, which should speed up
       symbol searches.
       A new table is used to store names of loaded package files,
       in order to prevent loading a file more than once.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add support for third-party packages (08-Jul-2000):
       The new <use> tag is similar to the synonym Perl command.
       Files are searched in directories specified with the -I
       command-line flag, then in directories listed in MP4HPATH
       if this environment variable exists, last under
       /usr/local/share/mp4h (or any other location specified at
       configure time).
       Package files have a .mp4hp suffix, which is removed when
       calling <use>.
       If filename contains colons, they are replaced by slashes and
       so represent directory names.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Internal changes about regular expressions (06-Jul-2000):
       Mp4h now uses the POSIX functions of the GNU libc regex.c instead
       of old GNU functions.  The most important reason for this change
       is that previous functions are not documented, and so hard to
       maintain.
       Moreover i had to patch the regex functions to allow the
       ``singleline=true'' attribute.
       With this new version it works out of the box, and many memory
       leaks are also fixed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Restore grouping around <attributes-quotes> (06-Jul-2000):
       Like other <attributes-*> tags, <attributes-quotes> did not group
       its expansion into a single token.
       It does now, because it seems that it is more useful in general
       cases.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix boolean operators (05-Jul-2000):
       The <and> tag was broken, and <or> has been cleaned up.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve <preserve>/<restore> stuff (05-Jul-2000):
       These tags accept now any number of arguments, so it is possible
       to write
           <define-tag foo>
           <preserve name src text>
           <set-var %attributes>
           ... code using `name', `src' and `text' variables.
           <restore  name src text>
           </define-tag>
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Better control with <return> tag (04-Jul-2000):
       With `up=0', closes all current macro expansion.
       With `up=-1', closes all current macro expansion and stops
       processing current file.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Preserve whitespaces in attributes (04-Jul-2000):
       Meta-HTML did preserve whitespaces in attributes.  Even if it is
       not very useful, some people may need this feature to format
       thier output files as wanted.
       This change fixes also the `whitespace=delete' attribute, which
       did remove newlines in attributes.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix <return> (04-Jul-2000):
       This tag could cause segmentation fault.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New <compound> tag for grouping (02-Jul-2000):
       It does exactly the same job as <group>, but this tag is
       complex.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New tags to affect attributes (01-Jul-2000):
       The <attributes-extract> and <attributes-remove> tags allow
       extraction and removal of specific attributes from %attributes.
       And <attributes-quote> prints the list of attributes with quotes
       around attribute values.
       [Denis Barbier, Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Reintroduce support for dmalloc (28-Jun-2000):
       Original m4 sources provide support for dmalloc, a great
       malloc debugger.  This support is activated via the --with-dmalloc
       flag at configure time.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3:

    *) Fix localization (26-Jun-2000):
       Localization was not fully effective because it uses some
       internal tables which were not updated when l10n is modified.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix non-ASCII characters (26-Jun-2000):
       Previous versions of mp4h had some problem of endianness,
       which may occur with non-ASCII text.
       [Max H. Duenki <duenki@isi.ee.ethz.ch>]

    *) Fix frozen state files mechanism (24-Jun-2000):
       Frozen state files are unusable in mp4h-1.0.2.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Parse bad formed closing tags (24-Jun-2000):
       With previous versions, closing tags with attributes confuse
       mp4h.  They are now accepted, even if not desirable in input
       files.
       [Fritz Zaucker <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch>]

  Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2:

    *) Improve output routines (22-Jun-2000):
       Changes are performed to remove some unused garbage.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix verbatim inclusion of files by mp4h (22-Jun-2000):
       An endianness problem caused unexpected results when including
       files verbatim. And text included this way could not appear
       inside other tags.  Both problems have been solved.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1:

    *) Fix '<*' form on some platforms (21-Jun-2000):
       At least on SunOS, an error is reported under some circumstances.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.9.5 and 1.0.0:

    *) Numerous clean-ups and documentation enhancements (19-Jun-2000):
       Macro parser is now very robust, and extensible with the -X flag.
       It should be useful to any HTML (or XHTML) writer which wants a
       simple but powerful macro-processor.
       Documentation is enhanced, but need some more work.
       Expansion behaviour has been deeply reviewed since 0.9.5, see
       documentation for details.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change expansion flags (18-Jun-2000):
       Two flags have been switched, and two new options added to
       remove leading and trailing star in tag names.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change valid tag names (17-Jun-2000):
       Valid tag names now match [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9:-]*
       Previous versions also accept `%' sign, which is removed
       not to conflict with ASP notation.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove control characters from debug output (16-Jun-2000):
       There were some garbage in debug output caused by control
       characters, which are now filtered.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix string substitution (14-Jun-2000):
       With some complex expressions, string substitution did not
       work properly.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix logical operators (14-Jun-2000):
       With some complex expressions, <and>, <or> and <not> logical
       operators did not work properly.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change default behaviour (13-Jun-2000):
       The removal of trailing star in tag name is suppressed, because
       it cannot deal with all cases.  The only right approach is to
       use a post-processor (this brilliant thought has changed on
       18-Jun-2000).
       Escaping mechanism has also been reviewed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove French documentation (07-Jun-2000):
       English version is now the only one maintained.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove trailing star in tag name (04-Jun-2000):
       Because of new parsing scheme, complex HTML tags must be well
       nested.  When this is not the case, e.g. only begin or end tag is
       to be processed, there must be a way to let mp4h believe that
       following tag is simple without putting a trailing slash in
       attributes.  This is done by appending a star to the tag name,
       both in begin and end tag.  This star is automatically removed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New tags added (04-Jun-2000):
       Tags <lb/>, <rb/>, <dq/> and <bs/> allow protection of the
       following special characters: `<', `>', '"' and '\'.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add -X flag to test parser (03-Jun-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix compilation bug in src/builtin.c (01-Jun-2000):
       [<gaa@ulticom.com>]

    *) Provide a way to read tokens without parsing (01-Jun-2000):
       All characters between <@[ and ]@> are read without parsing,
       this is very useful to read malformed mp4h tags.  These
       delimiters may be changed with the <set-quotes> tag.
       [Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>]

  Changes between 0.9.4 and 0.9.5:

    *) Change evaluation of unknown tags (22-May-2000):
       Until now, unknown tags were treated like normal text, i.e. left
       angle bracket lose their special meaning.  This has very
       strange side effects when such tags appear in attributes.
       [many people]

    *) Fix trailing slash (06-May-2000):
       When there was no attribute and no space before the slash sign,
       as in <br/>, this tag was not expanded.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.9.3 and 0.9.4:

    *) Changes in l10n (03-May-2000):
       I do not know how to deal with locales in a portable way, so
       examples are removed from documentation.  Only English
       documentation is build, but you may continue to compile the
       French one if your environment variables are rightly set.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Syntax change in the <let> tag (03-May-2000):
       New syntax is <let cmd1=cmd2>, similar to TeX and more
       user friendly.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.9.2 and 0.9.3:

    *) Ease building of Debian package (20-Apr-2000):
       I added a new `deb' target to build Debian packages
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Do not invoke tidy on HTML documentation (20-Apr-2000):
       By default HTML documentation is no more post-processed by
       tidy because some old versions break compilation.  This feature
       is available with the --with-tidy flag of the configure script.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix compilation on some platforms (20-Apr-2000):
       [Stephane Bortzmeyer <bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr>]

    *) Better handling of trailing slashes (20-Apr-2000):
       Now a trailing slash in <command "foo/"> is not removed
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

  Changes between 0.9.1 and 0.9.2:

    *) New array-topvalue tag (18-Apr-2000):
       This tag prints the last entry in an array.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Better handling of trailing slashes (18-Apr-2000):
       It was very difficult to prevent suppression of trailing slash
       in attributes.  Now it can be done by putting spaces between this
       slash and the closing bracket.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Many cosmetic changes (13-Apr-2000):
       Mp4h is now spelled mp4h in lowercase letters in all files.
       Some source files are fixed to produce no warning at compilation
       time.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  Changes between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1:

    *) Fix bugs with extra quotes in attributes (03-Apr-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bugs in grouping (03-Apr-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove a trailing slash in attributes (01-Apr-2000):
       When reading attributes of single tags, a trailing slash is
       ignored.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.8.5 and 0.9.0:

    *) Customization of number output format (01-Apr-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add support for localization (01-Apr-2000):
       New <mp4h-l10n> macro defines locale settings.
       By default, locale is set to C.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change arguments of array functions (01-Apr-2000):
       To be more intuitive, first argument of all array-related
       macros is now the name of the variable containing the array.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change some array functions (31-Mar-2000):
       The <array-append> tag is replaced by <array-push> and
       <array-pop> is added.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Implicit array indexes (29-Mar-2000):
       The expression <get-var foo[i]> is a shorthand for
       <get-var foo[<get-var i>]>.
       [Jan Holler <jh@inetcom.ch>]

    *) Fix warning messages (29-Mar-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.8.5 and 0.8.4:

    *) Fix bug with some nested expressions (27-Mar-2000):
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura <tutimura@nn.iij4u.or.jp>]

  Changes between 0.8.4 and 0.8.3:

    *) Change in grouping (25-Mar-2000):
       The quoted=true attribute of the <group> tag is removed and this
       feature is now provided by the <noexpand> tag. Its counterpart is
       <expand>.
       New attribute of <group> : ``separator=string''
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix memory leaks (22-Mar-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add <return> tag (20-Mar-2000):
       This tag exits from inner macro.
       [Uwe Mindrup <uwe@mindrup.de>]

    *) Add %name in replacement text (20-Mar-2000):
       This special string expands to the macro name when found in
       replacement text.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Bugfix in replacement text (18-Mar-2000):
       Letters `A' and `U' after a percent sign were gobbled by mp4h
       in macro replacement text.
       [Joerg Plate <Joerg@Plate.cx>]

  Changes between 0.8.3 and 0.8.2:

    *) Add macro hooks (15-Mar-2000):
       These hooks are provided to allow inserting text before or after
       macro expansion. This way it becomes easy to transform primitives
       or defined macros.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix build failure on FreeBSD (15-Mar-2000):
       There was a bug in lib/xmalloc.c which causes a build failure
       on FreeBSD.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@engelschall.com>]

  Changes between 0.8.2 and 0.8.1:

    *) Cosmetic changes in documentation (11-Mar-2000):
       These changes are made to allow automatic generation of
       http://www.engelschall.com/sw/mp4h/docs/index.html
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Suppress whitespace after discarded newlines (11-Mar-2000):
       When newlines are discarded via the <dnl> tag or eol-comments,
       leading whitespaces on following line are removed.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.8.1 and 0.8.0:

    *) Remove unused subroutines (02-Mar-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix again how unknown macros are expanded (01-Mar-2000):
       This time, no expansion is done.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.8.0 and 0.7.2:

    *) English documentation (28-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix <unset-var> tag (28-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Internal change in <include> tag (28-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Expand attributes in unknown macros (28-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Internal changes in macro parser (26-Feb-2000):
       The macro parser is remade in order to be more robust. Expansion
       modes are now explained in the doc.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) More comprehensive messages on error (18-Feb-2000):
       When a warning is printed, it includes file name and line
       number.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix support for frozen files (18-Feb-2000):
       This is the first working version.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Merge synclines tags into <__file__> and <__line__> (16-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.7.2 and 0.7.1:

    *) Add <synclines-push> and <synclines-pop> tags (16-Feb-2000):
       These macros will help debugging within WML.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove <eval> and <quote> tags (16-Feb-2000):
       A change in how macros are quoted and evalled make these macros
       useless.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 0.7.1 and 0.7.0:

    *) Fix escaped quotes in attributes (13-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix expansion of malformed tags (13-Feb-2000):
       When an opening angle is followed by a valid name, which is
       neither followed by a space nor a closing angle, this rag must
       be written verbatim. For instance, <a+1> was expanded into <a>+1>.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add tags: <capitalize> <at-end-of-file> <eval> (13-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow spaces in variable assignments (13-Feb-2000):
       Constructs like <set-var i = 0> are now parsed like <set-var i=0>.
       [Denis Barbier]


  mp4h 0.7.0 (11-Feb-2000):
    First public release.
