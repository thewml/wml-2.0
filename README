  WML is a free and extensible Webdesigner's off-line HTML generation
  toolkit for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License
  (GPL v2). It is written in ANSI C and Perl 5, built via a GNU Autoconf
  based source tree and runs out-of-the-box on all major Unix derivates.
  It can be used free of charge both in educational and commercial
  environments.
  
  WML consists of a control frontend driving up to nine backends in a
  sequential pass-oriented filtering scheme. Each backend provides one
  particular core language. For maximum power WML additionally ships
  with a well-suited set of include files which provide higher-level
  features build on top of the backends core languages. While not
  trivial and idiot proof WML provides most of the core features real
  hackers always wanted for HTML generation.
